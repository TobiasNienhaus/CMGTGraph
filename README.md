# CMGT Graph

A graph implementation for a university course.

## What this is

> **Please do not use this in any production code!**
> It is not meant for that.
> You can use it however you want (for now), just don't blame me if something breaks.

This is a part of an assignment for algorithms in university. I wanted to try and develop the part about creating a graph class and implementing pathfinding in a seperate DLL to gain experience in things like that.

> If you need a graph implementation for production, use [QuickGraph](https://www.nuget.org/packages/QuickGraph/).

## NuGet

This project is published on NuGet [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CMGTGraph/). You probably shouldn't use it for any production code, because it is not meant for that.
